# top-rock-paper-scissors
This is the final Rock, Paper, Scissors project for The Odin Project.
For some reason Github doesn't like the source of the custom font I chose, so
I'd like to suggest cloning the repo to be able to "play" the game.

Future versions:
1.01. Add play again modal,
      Fix bug that keeps counting the loser's points after the game is finished.
